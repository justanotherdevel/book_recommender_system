            "Wow, another great series from Denise Grover Swank!!  I didn't think I could love another of Denise's characters as much as I love Rose Gardner, but I think Magnolia Steele is sitting right there next to Rose.  First of all, EVERY SINGLE book that Denise has written captures my attention and my heart from the very first pages.  Center Stage is no different, your heart goes out to Magnolia as she is dealing with both her recent humiliation in New York City and the fear she feels from the events that happened 10 years ago, events that she can't remember but knows they were terrifying and caused her to leave Franklin, TN the very next day.  The action kicks up rather quickly as a murder occurs, and of course Magnolia is in the wrong place at the wrong time and becomes the lead suspect. She takes it upon herself, along with some new friends and family, to investigate the crime and clear her name. Along the way, she finds herself in some awkward, scary, and surprising situations.Being home brings back more memories of the terrifying experience that caused her to leave 10 years ago, and some anonymous communications warning Magnolia to essentially keep it buried leave you at the edge of your seat to find out what happened on that fateful night.Seeing and interacting with people from her past leaves you feeling the guilt, sadness, and even anger that Magnolia is experiencing.  I really enjoyed the fact that the new people that come into her circle give her a sense of happiness, belonging, and even possible romance.While the murders seem to be resolved by the end of this installment, I am not so sure that's the end of it.  There is certainly many things left to explore, especially the characters and what happened since she left, potential love interests, the mystery of the fateful night all those years ago, and I almost forgot her DAD...I am so excited to see how these things play out and what adventures Magnolia is sure to get in as the series evolves.  I am already impatiently waiting for the next book!!",
            "My mother used to call this kind of book popcorn for the brain..  It's a good book for when you just want a great read and nothing to intense.  IT was just what I was looking for",

            "Bone Baby is a gripping story about horrifying secrets and unforgivable crimes.Lily and her partner lived with a terrible secret. While Charlotte Mary pushed her feelings away, Lily felt the weight of the truth every day. Neither of them spoke about it. When Charlotte Mary dies, Lily finally decides to make things right.Having always lived in the shadow of her partner, Lily finds a new freedom in trying to rectify the mistake of her youth. But as she delves deeper in her search for answers, her actions will have consequences she could never have imagined.Dickson's writing is engaging with authentic dialogue. The characters' actions have unexpected results and you're always guessing about what will happen next. Lily really carries the novel - it's from her perspective that the storyline unfolds - so it's fortunate that Dickson has created such a relatable, if unexpected, heroine. Lily is an ordinary person in extraordinary circumstances. She is driven by wanting to do the right thing, but Dickson's plot has her weaving through moral grey areas and ultimately Lily must face doing the unthinkable.You're unable to stop wondering: what would I have done?",

            "If you like mindless action and violence, you may like this story, though over half the book is spent on Teddy's introspection as she ponders things in her mind, so it may be too dull for the violence lovers.  I gave it 2 Stars for effort since I didn't notice any flagrant typos or grammar errors, and there was one line I especially liked where Teddy was trying to decide if she could trust one of the guys after he helped her:\"All of these things have the arrow pointing up on Gordo. However, like I do with everyone, I'll put him on a series of one-day contracts. Those contracts are constantly up for review.\"  It's an interesting way to look at life and relationships.Unfortunately, the story itself was too unbelievable and unrealistic for me to finish and I finally stopped at 84%. There were just too many places where the story defied logic.  The bad guys seemed to always attack Teddy in twos and threes rather than in a big bunch, so she can kill them off easier. They catch her in a restaurant but only sit down with her in an intimidating way rather than shoot her outright, and only make their move when the owner tells them to leave.  Then they shoot the owner in cold blood, in front of witnesses no less, giving Teddy time to get her own gun out and shoot them before they can finish her off.  If they wanted her dead, why didn't the just shoot her right off?In every encounter Teddy gets injured but it doesn't affect her in the next scene.  For example, in the first attack she is head butted in the face, feeling her sinus cavities smashed and filling with blood, yet in the next chapter, as she drives away in her eye-catching red porsche, she makes no mention of it bothering her. Actually, Teddy's body takes tremendous abuse that would likely kill anyone else, yet she's able to fight off trained professional killers and keep making wise cracks (..many of which were actually amusing).The story also suffers from the old cowboy \"white hat\" syndrome.  Teddy, who is a novice shooter and didn't even know she needed to load the gun in her first encounter, was able to shoot and hit every bad guy, usually on the first shot, even after suffering grievous injuries, while the hired trained killers always miss her.  They kill everyone around Teddy with a single shot, but they can't hit Teddy.The police are none existent in the story, other than sirens in the distance.  With that many public shootings I'm pretty sure the cops would be a little more alert and on the ball, and would no doubt do some investigating.  So far, that hasn't happened.I feel the author has good writing skills and with changes I think the author could make this a much more realistic and enjoyable story.  As it's written right now, I can't recommend it.",
            "This is a very fast-paced interesting read.  I won't share any information on what happens in the story because I don't care for it when other people do it.  I will say that this book had me interested from the start and I read it cover to cover in just one sitting - while ignoring my life around me.  Great job telling this fabulous story.",

She is not unhappy with her life, but of course that won't last...A very bizarre  man comes into her life with a strange proposal that may enrich her...if it doesn't kill her... According to this bizarre \"Gordon\", her previous life (what little she can remember) was a lie...and if she just signs up for a deal in NYC, she could be set for life...details to be added later. Thus begins one of the darkest comedies (and one of the funniest) that I have ever read!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

After making a life altering decision she has to take a stand to keep her life. Along the way she runs into many characters that aren't happy with her still breathing. It's an exciting , action packed book with a surprise twist for an ending!!!",

Mr. Baily's first endeavour grips you from the first page and doesn't leave you until you hear final verdict from jury members. Writer knows how to tell a story and make it page turning even if you kind of know how will it end and you know who is the criminal here.

He then teams up with a former student to work on a case that involves the death of multiple people by a speeding truck. The emotional struggle between the characters resonates with realism.The story involves an example of how big companies with money and muscle power try to get away with crimes they commit. The scenes are well-paced, and there are elements of suspense throughout the book.This is the first book in a series. One of my favourite characters in The Professor, Bocephus Haynes plays the leading role in the second book, and I am sure to read it soon.",

            "this book had a very genuine ending not that interesting........i thought that it would have an unexpected ending as it started intrestingly but it had an very very expected ending",
            "The Text is a free Kindle short by British author, Claire Douglas. Emily Latimer is incensed when she sends a text to her boyfriend about her boss, Andrew. In her anger, she makes a critical spelling error and picks the wrong recipient. But when Andrew turns up dead the next morning, that text message causes her problems. A very short story (25 pages) with a few twists and populated with a few nasty types. The last 15 pages are an extract of  Last Seen Alive. Average.",

            "Great Book...",
            "VERY NICE PRODUCT",
            "If you love Sherlock Holmes, you will love these BBC Books, which are around 200-300 pages, and written in medium fonts. Most Sherlock Holmes collections are fat books, written in minuscule fonts, which make them unsuitable if you want to gift to your teenage child. The very volume and font size would put them off. This one does a good job on those two areas.And about Sherlock Holmes books itself - what more needs to be said?",

            "Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \"it was the band, the speckled band!\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.There are plenty of both kinds in \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes. An absolute must-read.",
